# Code Coach

This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform that assists ACM student members in mastering 
the skills to solve intricate ICPC problems. The platform will utilize a large language model to 
assess and provide feedback on answers submitted by students.

---

## ⭐ Overview
The scope of our project includes the following:
  A responsive web interface for users to interact with the platform
  A database of ACM ICPC problems and similar competitive programming challenges
  An integrated code editor where users can write and execute code in Python (initially), with support in other languages in the future.
  An AI assistant that helps users understand and solve problems through its responses. 
  A section where users can discuss problems and solutions is similar to a forum.
  A dedicated area for users to practice interview questions. 

...

## 🚀 Motivation
The software is intended for students preparing for competitive programming contests and technical job 
interviews. The strategic aim is to provide an interactive and supportive learning environment that uses 
AI to enhance the user experience and learning outcomes.
