<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## üí° Overview

**Code Coach** is a platform designed as part of our senior design project to empower students at the University of Michigan - Dearborn ACM chapter by providing a comprehensive suite of tools for preparing for competitive programming contests and technical interviews. 

Our platform emphasizes:

- **Interactive learning**: Users can engage with problems through an integrated code editor and receive AI-driven assistance.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Built using **React** for the frontend and **AWS** for backend services, including **API Gateway** and **Lambda** functions, for a robust and scalable user experience.
- **Community Collaboration**: Discussion forums and a collaborative environment for problem-solving and interview preparation.

Our key features include a **Problems Page** for exploring coding challenges, a **Problem Solving Page** with real-time code execution and an AI assistant, and an **Interview Prep Page** to help students excel in their technical job interviews.

<!-- MOTIVATION -->
## üöÄ Motivation

The primary motivation for Code Coach is to address the challenges students face in preparing for competitive programming contests and technical job interviews. Research shows that early engagement in competitive programming can significantly enhance problem-solving skills, boost confidence, and improve academic performance.

> "The participation of freshmen in competitions has a positive effect in early motivation and retention, as well as on their final grade in introductory courses."
    ‚Äî Ribeiro & Guerreiro, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228411471_Early_introduction_of_competitive_programming" target="_blank">*Early Introduction of Competitive Programming*</a>


Our platform aims to create a supportive environment that encourages students to start early, practice consistently, and ultimately excel in these critical areas. By integrating AI assistance, a curated problem database, and a collaborative community, Code Coach empowers students to achieve their full potential.


<!-- DESIGN CHOICES -->
## üõ†Ô∏è Design Choices

<!-- Architecture subsection -->
### üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Our platform utilizes a **modern serverless architecture** to achieve scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. By leveraging **AWS API Gateway** and **AWS Lambda** functions for our backend, we eliminate the need for traditional server management. API Gateway handles all incoming HTTP requests, routing them to specific Lambda functions that execute our backend logic. This setup allows us to scale seamlessly as our user base grows, reducing the overhead of managing dedicated servers.

<!-- Tech Stack subsection -->
### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend**

Built using **React**, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. React's component-based architecture enables reusability and efficient state management.

**Backend**
  - **AWS API Gateway:** Serves as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate Lambda functions.
  - **AWS Lambda:** Executes backend logic in a serverless environment, ensuring effortless scalability without the need for physical server management.
  - **MongoDB Atlas:** A cloud-based NoSQL database used for storing user data, problem sets, and other critical information. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling diverse data types and its robust querying capabilities.

**AI Integration** 

The platform utilizes a **Mistral LLM** to provide the AI-driven assistance in problem-solving. The AI assistant will be aware of the problem the user is currently working on and the user's written solution so that it can provide personalized assistance.

<!-- Key Features subsection -->
### ‚úÖ Key Features

Our platform is designed to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly experience, with the following key features:

**Home Page**
